## Features

ephysics has the following features:

- Rigid body dynamics
- Discrete collision detection
- Collision shapes (Sphere, Box, Cone, Cylinder, Capsule, Convex Mesh, static Concave Mesh, Height Field)
- Multiple collision shapes per body
- Broadphase collision detection (Dynamic AABB tree)
- Narrowphase collision detection (GJK/EPA)
- Collision response and friction (Sequential Impulses Solver)
- Joints (Ball and Socket, Hinge, Slider, Fixed)
- Collision filtering with categories
- Ray casting
- Sleeping technique for inactive bodies
- Integrated Profiler
- Multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)
- No dependencies (only OpenGL for the testbed application)
- Documentation (User manual and Doxygen API)
- Testbed application with demo scenes
- Unit tests
